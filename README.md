        Forms:

            Use three radio buttons to select an image background for the canvas.

            Add a slider to:

                Control the X or Y position of a character on the canvas. Depending on the character moves up/down or side to side. Limit the amount that the character can move.

            Include three checkboxes to:

                Make Item 1 appear or disappear on the screen.

                Make Item 2 appear or disappear on the screen.

                Make Item 3 appear or disappear on the screen.

            Add three buttons to:

                Trigger Sound Effect 1.

                Trigger Sound Effect 2.

                Trigger Sound Effect 3.

        Canvas:

            Draw a scene on the canvas based on the user's selections and inputs from the forms.

            Ensure that the scene is dynamic and updates in real-time as users interact with the forms.

        Interactivity:

            Implement JavaScript to handle form inputs and update the canvas accordingly.

            Incorporate sound effects that play when specific buttons are clicked.
